* Its a very simple java lib which allows users to capture various metrics from within running jvm and store them locally using rrd4j library.<br>
* JMX metrics are captured out of box. Library also expose single liner code to add any user defined metrics either explicitly or by writing threaded metric monitors.<br>
* Such stored metrics can be viewed, graphed to make meaningful decisions in terms of scaling, improving performance and functional aspects.<br>
* This library can be embedded within any existing java application to get meaningful metrics driven information with in few minutes.
